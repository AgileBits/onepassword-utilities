# Utilities for 1Password

This project is a collection of utilities contributed by the 1Password community. 

A huge hat tip to [@MrC](https://discussions.agilebits.com/profile/77142/MrC) for creating the convert_to_1p4 utility and contributing it to help as many people as possible. 

## Downloading

[Download the 1Password utilities (master.zip)](https://github.com/AgileBits/onepassword-utilities/archive/master.zip) and unzip the file on your Desktop.

The instructions in the README for the convert_to_1p4 utility assume you have the onepassword-utilities folder on your Desktop.

## Contributing Your Utility

If you'd like to contribute your utility, you have a few options:

1. For the `git` savvy people, fork this repo and submit a Pull Request (Preferred).
2. For those who haven't mastered `git`, simply post a message in the [1Password Discussion Forums](https://discussions.agilebits.com/) that includes your script and mention your desire to add it here.

Given the nature of 1Password, we need to manually review all scripts before including them here.
