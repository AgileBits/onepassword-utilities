Version 1.07:
  - New: The keepass2 converter will decode and convert an entry's attachments. They are placed in a folder
    named 1P4_Attachments in the same location that the 1P4_import.1pif file will be created.  An entry's
    attachments are placed in a sub-directory named with the entry's Title.
  - Fix: The keepass2 converter sometimes failed to parse an entry's modification time (and theoretically could
    have failed to parse other items correctly).  To resolve this, and to robustly support attachments, the parser
    was rewritten, using different XML parsing modules.
  - Fix: Essentialpim converter might have missed detection of the notes or title of a customized entry due
    to an off-by-one error iterating through a loop.
  - New: CSV converter.  This converter is just a basic CSV converter that currently only supports Logins and
    Notes.  It will be customized or updated as necessary to accommodate specific user needs.
  - Change: make UUID values all uppercase; 1Password was expecting these when using OPVault (used for creating
    band files).

Version 1.06:
  - New: LicenseKeeper converter now available.
  - New: Password Agent converter now available.
  - New: Spb Wallet converter now available.
  - New: AppleScript helper applet makes conversion easier for OS X users.  Just drag your password manager's
    exported data file onto the helper applet "AppleScript_Conversion_Helper", and follow the instructions.
  - Change: Updated the README to accommodate the new OS X AppleScript_Conversion_Helper.
  - Fix: Update the README to provide a workaround for problematic exports with the LastPass extension in Chrome.
  - Fix: PasswordWallet conveter now handles the reserved auto-type characters that may be present in
    username or password fields.  The tab and reverse tab characters will split the field when within
    a value, and data that follows will be placed in Notes as username- or password-specific
    field/value pairs, as in "username_part_2: next", "username_part_3: field", etc.
  - Change: Changed the stylesheet used to render the README.pdf.

Version 1.05:

  - New: Norton Identity Safe converter now available.
  - New: Country code patterns added to convert common country strings into 1Password country codes (used for
    address types).
  - Change: default output file is now 1P_export.1pif.
  - Change: README modified to accommodate usage of new onepif2html converter.
  - Fix: README.pdf had white-on-white text when viewed in Acrobat.

  - New: Passpack converter now available.
  - New: PasswordWallet converter now available.
  - New: Option --modified will set the 'last modified' field for a 1Password entry based on the exported modification
    date provided by a password manager's export data.  See 'Option: --modified' in the README file.
  - Fix: An item's notes from OS X Keychain converter could contain a stringified ARRAY reference name.
  - Fix: The modification and creation dates were missing from the notes section for the OS X Keychain converter.
  - Internal: Remove extraneous, remnant argument to UUID generation call.

Version 1.03:
  - New: EssentialPIM converter now available.
  - New: Password Depot converter now available.
  - New: Folder creation is supported, but disabled by default.  Password managers that support folders or groups are:
    ewallet, handysafe, keepass2, keepassx, lastpass, msecure, safewallet, splashid.  Include the --folders option on
    the command line to enable folders.  Tags will still include colon-separated folder hierarchies.  See the README
    for caveats when using this option.
  - Fix: The 'location' field was not being set - it is required for 1Password for Window's extension to see the entry.
  - Fix: Typo in README file that left an extra directory level in the conversion command.
  - New: Added Secure Notes export to Keychain converter.  Also, added an entry to the table of ignored svce names.

Version 1.02:
  - Change: Set default decoder for SplashID back to macroman.
  - New: Specifically support SplashID's 'Addressess' category (into Secure Notes).
  - Fix: Converter keepass2 was incorrectly splitting a group name that contained certain XML-reserved characters.
  - Fix: README updates: clarify LastPass export instructions; enumerate and better describe Step 4; clarify
    that attachments are not unsupported; describe a workflow for creating Folders from tagged values; remove extra
    subdirectory layer onepassword-utilities, and instruct users to place convert_to_1p4 directly onto the Desktop.
  - Change: The README file eliminates the extra folder layer onepassword-utilities and instead refers to the
    convert_to_1p4 folder.

Version 1.01:
  - Fix: More precisely construct the path to the Desktop on Windows, for the 1PIF export file, and add some debug output
    to help in any future issues.
  - New: Update SafeWallet converter to support the Windows 3.x XML version, and new categories 'irc' and 'server'.
  - Fix: SplashID converter was mishandling two or more adjacent F records.
  - Info: SplashID export encoding is suspect - added commented out decoding line in code to help users try alternate
    decoding (UTF-8 vs. macroman).
  - Change: Updated documentation to switch from ActivePerl to Strawberry Perl, since ActiveState removed 5.16 from their
    free downloads.

Version 1.00:
  - Initial release of password manager module-based converter which consolidates previous converters into a single utility.
  - Outputs converted data to 1Password's robust 1PIF format.
  - Obsoletes CSV exporter available in previous converters.

  - All converters tested/retested on OS X and Windows (where relevant).
