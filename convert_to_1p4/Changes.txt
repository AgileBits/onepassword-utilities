Version 1.02:
  - Change: Set default decoder for SplashID back to macroman.
  - New: specifically support SplashID's 'Addressess' category (into Secure Notes).
  - Fix: Converter keepass2 was incorrectly splitting a group name that contained certain XML-reserved characters.
  - Fix: README updates: clarify LastPass export instructions; enumerate and better describe Step 4; clarify
    that attachments are not unsupported; describe a workflow for creating Folders from tagged values; remove extra
    subdirectory layer onepassword-utilities, and instruct users to place convert_to_1p4 directly onto the Desktop.
  - Change: The README file eliminates the extra folder layer onepassword-utilities and instead refers to the
    convert_to_1p4 folder.

Version 1.01:
  - Fix: More precisely construct the path to the Desktop on Windows, for the 1PIF export file, and add some debug output
    to help in any future issues.
  - New: Update SafeWallet converter to support the Windows 3.x XML version, and new categories 'irc' and 'server'.
  - Fix: SplashID converter was mishandling two or more adjacent F records.
  - Info: SplashID export encoding is suspect - added commented out decoding line in code to help users try alternate
    decoding (UTF-8 vs. macroman).
  - Change: Updated documentation to switch from ActivePerl to Strawberry Perl, since ActiveState removed 5.16 from their
    free downloads.
