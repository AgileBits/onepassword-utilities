Version 1.08:
  New Converters:
  - RoboForm converter now available.
  - Keeper Desktop converter now available.
  - Txt2notes converter now available, converts text files into Secure Notes.
  - F-Secure KEY converter now available.
  - Passwords Plus converter now available (OS X).

  New Features:
  - Option --addfields or -a will create custom fields for non-mappable fields instead of placing
    them into notes.
  - Option --tags or -t will add the specified comma-separated list of tags to each record.
  - The keepassx converter will decode and convert an entry's attachment. It is placed in a folder
    named 1P4_Attachments in the same location that the 1P4_import.1pif file will be created.  An entry's
    attachment is placed in a sub-directory named with the entry's Title.
  - The vcard converter option --securenote will place vCard data into a Secure Note, with custom fields
    similar to an Identity.
  - The 1PIF module supports icons if either of the Perl 'GD' or 'Image::Magick' libraries are available.
  - The vCard converter will include icons when the --icon option is specified (and the required
    library is available - see previous note).
  - Added more import types to handysafe converter; added a multiple field-matching system to assist
    category detection.
  - The handysafe converter now has support for localalization (lang nl-nl).  More languages will be added
    as requested.
  - Languages directory for per-converter language translation files.
  - Added output diagnostic to onepif2html converter to indicate the name of the created output file.
  - Add support for 1Password's 'Password' category.
  - The csv converter now accepts a Tags column.  The comma-separated values within that column will be
    imported as 1Password Tags.

  Changed:
  - The --help option is a little more instructive.
  - Converter ewallet's combolock and voicemail categories go to the Password category now.
  - Converter splashid's frequentflyer now maps to the 1Password Rewards category.

  Fixed:
  - Several fixes for the onepif2html print converter: strip the BOM on Windows 1PIF exports; gracefully
    handle unknown 1PIF typeNames; support the legacy typeNames allowed in the Windows UI.
  - Minor Perl syntax changes throughout the code to satisfy Perl versions > 5.16.
  - Remove extraneous, but harmless setting of imptypes in essetialpim converter.
  - Remove extraneous comment in msecure converter; fixed duplicate key in frequentflyer definition.
  - Splashid converter was not honoring --imptypes for user-defined types (user defined types are
    specified as 'userdefined'.
  - Splashid converter was not converting \b end of line characters into newline characters in
    an entry's notes section (Windows only).
  - The debug function unfold_and_chop() was not honoring its maxlen parameter.
  - The debug function print_record was not outputing notes.
  - Date parsing was broken in some cases for converters ewallet and lastpass.
  - Several ewallet converter fixes.
  - The safewallet converter was incorrectly detecting a web login category as an irc category.
  - Several vcard converter fixes: 1) prevent vcard converter from importing an encoded photo into the notes
    section; 2) converter was bailing after the first entry in a list of vcards.  3) Uses a new module for
    parsing / packaging vCard data (Text::vFile::asData). 4) Handles vCard exports via iCloud.
  - The handysafe converter was not picking up root-level nodes.
  - Some debug output errors in Utils::PIF.pm.
  - A date converter routine for some converters could cause an error under anomalous conditions - affected
    converters: dataguardian, ironkey, keepass2, keepassx, keychain, passwordagent, passworddepot, spbwallet.
  - The datavault converter on Windows could botch some multiline entries in the notes section.
  - The onepif2html converter was not outputing a label for unlabeled URLs.
  - The onepif2html converter was not handling the Password category.
  - Converter keychain now avoids outputting a 0x0 (nil) hexvalue as a URI protocol.
  - Converter keychain export instructions for iCloud keychain export was missing part of the fully-qualified
    keychain name (e.g. local-icloud should have been local-icloud.keychain).

  Internal Changes:
  - Miscellaneous code refactoring and consolidating.
  - New module Utils::Normalize.
  - Simplify the lastpass converter's %card_field_specs table.
  - convert_to_1p4 will now accept and pass to a converter more than a single filename argument.
  - Modified the %card_field_specs table to include custom field definitions within the table.
  - Made the normalize_card_data() function universal, and moved it to Utils::PIF.pm.
  - Code updates to work with Perl versions newer than the old requirement of Perl 5.16.
  - Debug output will include info about the export file supplied on the command line.
  - Many code cleanups.

Version 1.07:
  - New: The keepass2 converter will decode and convert an entry's attachments. They are placed in a folder
    named 1P4_Attachments in the same location that the 1P4_import.1pif file will be created.  An entry's
    attachments are placed in a sub-directory named with the entry's Title.
  - Fix: The keepass2 converter sometimes failed to parse an entry's modification time (and theoretically could
    have failed to parse other items correctly).  To resolve this, and to robustly support attachments, the parser
    was rewritten, using different XML parsing modules.
  - Fix: Essentialpim converter might have missed detection of the notes or title of a customized entry due
    to an off-by-one error iterating through a loop.
  - New: CSV converter.  This converter is just a basic CSV converter that currently only supports Logins and
    Notes.  It will be customized or updated as necessary to accommodate specific user needs.
  - Change: make UUID values all uppercase; 1Password was expecting these when using OPVault (used for creating
    band files).

Version 1.06:
  - New: LicenseKeeper converter now available.
  - New: Password Agent converter now available.
  - New: Spb Wallet converter now available.
  - New: AppleScript helper applet makes conversion easier for OS X users.  Just drag your password manager's
    exported data file onto the helper applet "AppleScript_Conversion_Helper", and follow the instructions.
  - Change: Updated the README to accommodate the new OS X AppleScript_Conversion_Helper.
  - Fix: Update the README to provide a workaround for problematic exports with the LastPass extension in Chrome.
  - Fix: PasswordWallet conveter now handles the reserved auto-type characters that may be present in
    username or password fields.  The tab and reverse tab characters will split the field when within
    a value, and data that follows will be placed in Notes as username- or password-specific
    field/value pairs, as in "username_part_2: next", "username_part_3: field", etc.
  - Change: Changed the stylesheet used to render the README.pdf.

Version 1.05:
  - New: OS X Contacts converter (vcard), converts Contacts exports into identity entries.
  - New: 1PIF to HTML converter (onepif2html) for record printouts.
  - New: IronKey Identity Manager converter now available.
  - New: Norton Identity Safe converter now available.
  - New: Country code patterns added to convert common country strings into 1Password country codes (used for
    address types).
  - Change: default output file is now 1P_export.1pif.
  - Change: README modified to accommodate usage of new onepif2html converter.
  - Fix: README.pdf had white-on-white text when viewed in Acrobat.

Version 1.04:
  - New: Data Guardian converter now available.
  - New: Datavault converter now available.
  - New: Passpack converter now available.
  - New: PasswordWallet converter now available.
  - New: Option --modified will set the 'last modified' field for a 1Password entry based on the exported modification
    date provided by a password manager's export data.  See 'Option: --modified' in the README file.
  - Fix: An item's notes from OS X Keychain converter could contain a stringified ARRAY reference name.
  - Fix: The modification and creation dates were missing from the notes section for the OS X Keychain converter.
  - Internal: Remove extraneous, remnant argument to UUID generation call.

Version 1.03:
  - New: EssentialPIM converter now available.
  - New: Password Depot converter now available.
  - New: Folder creation is supported, but disabled by default.  Password managers that support folders or groups are:
    ewallet, handysafe, keepass2, keepassx, lastpass, msecure, safewallet, splashid.  Include the --folders option on
    the command line to enable folders.  Tags will still include colon-separated folder hierarchies.  See the README
    for caveats when using this option.
  - Fix: The 'location' field was not being set - it is required for 1Password for Window's extension to see the entry.
  - Fix: Typo in README file that left an extra directory level in the conversion command.
  - New: Added Secure Notes export to Keychain converter.  Also, added an entry to the table of ignored svce names.

Version 1.02:
  - Change: Set default decoder for SplashID back to macroman.
  - New: Specifically support SplashID's 'Addressess' category (into Secure Notes).
  - Fix: Converter keepass2 was incorrectly splitting a group name that contained certain XML-reserved characters.
  - Fix: README updates: clarify LastPass export instructions; enumerate and better describe Step 4; clarify
    that attachments are not unsupported; describe a workflow for creating Folders from tagged values; remove extra
    subdirectory layer onepassword-utilities, and instruct users to place convert_to_1p4 directly onto the Desktop.
  - Change: The README file eliminates the extra folder layer onepassword-utilities and instead refers to the
    convert_to_1p4 folder.

Version 1.01:
  - Fix: More precisely construct the path to the Desktop on Windows, for the 1PIF export file, and add some debug output
    to help in any future issues.
  - New: Update SafeWallet converter to support the Windows 3.x XML version, and new categories 'irc' and 'server'.
  - Fix: SplashID converter was mishandling two or more adjacent F records.
  - Info: SplashID export encoding is suspect - added commented out decoding line in code to help users try alternate
    decoding (UTF-8 vs. macroman).
  - Change: Updated documentation to switch from ActivePerl to Strawberry Perl, since ActiveState removed 5.16 from their
    free downloads.

Version 1.00:
  - Initial release of password manager module-based converter which consolidates previous converters into a single utility.
  - Outputs converted data to 1Password's robust 1PIF format.
  - Obsoletes CSV exporter available in previous converters.
  - Several new converters added.
  - Single, comprehensive README file.
  - Generalized 1PIF creation module, supports adding customized sections and fields to entries.
  - Table-driven password manager type/field recognizer, supports import record retyping and splitting.
  - Supports selection of both import and export types.
  - Lossless date-type handling, where sensible; unexpected, lossy, or nonsense dates are retained in notes.
  - Many improvements and enhancements to previous conveters.
  - All converters tested/retested on OS X and Windows (where relevant).
