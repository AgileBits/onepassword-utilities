Version 1.04:
  - New: Data Guardian converter now available.
  - New: Datavault converter now available.
  - New: Passpack converter now available.
  - New: PasswordWallet converter now available.
  - New: Option --modified will set the 'last modified' field for a 1Password entry based on the exported modification
    date provided by a password manager's export data.  See 'Option: --modified' in the README file.
  - Fix: An item's notes from OS X Keychain converter could contain a stringified ARRAY reference name.
  - Fix: The modification and creation dates were missing from the notes section for the OS X Keychain converter.
  - Internal: Remove extraneous, remnant argument to UUID generation call.

Version 1.03:
  - New: EssentialPIM converter now available.
  - New: Password Depot converter now available.
  - New: Folder creation is supported, but disabled by default.  Password managers that support folders or groups are:
    ewallet, handysafe, keepass2, keepassx, lastpass, msecure, safewallet, splashid.  Include the --folders option on
    the command line to enable folders.  Tags will still include colon-separated folder hierarchies.  See the README
    for caveats when using this option.
  - Fix: The 'location' field was not being set - it is required for 1Password for Window's extension to see the entry.
  - Fix: Typo in README file that left an extra directory level in the conversion command.
  - New: Added Secure Notes export to Keychain converter.  Also, added an entry to the table of ignored svce names.

Version 1.02:
  - Change: Set default decoder for SplashID back to macroman.
  - New: Specifically support SplashID's 'Addressess' category (into Secure Notes).
  - Fix: Converter keepass2 was incorrectly splitting a group name that contained certain XML-reserved characters.
  - Fix: README updates: clarify LastPass export instructions; enumerate and better describe Step 4; clarify
    that attachments are not unsupported; describe a workflow for creating Folders from tagged values; remove extra
    subdirectory layer onepassword-utilities, and instruct users to place convert_to_1p4 directly onto the Desktop.
  - Change: The README file eliminates the extra folder layer onepassword-utilities and instead refers to the
    convert_to_1p4 folder.

Version 1.01:
  - Fix: More precisely construct the path to the Desktop on Windows, for the 1PIF export file, and add some debug output
    to help in any future issues.
  - New: Update SafeWallet converter to support the Windows 3.x XML version, and new categories 'irc' and 'server'.
  - Fix: SplashID converter was mishandling two or more adjacent F records.
  - Info: SplashID export encoding is suspect - added commented out decoding line in code to help users try alternate
    decoding (UTF-8 vs. macroman).
  - Change: Updated documentation to switch from ActivePerl to Strawberry Perl, since ActiveState removed 5.16 from their
    free downloads.
